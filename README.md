[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/splitsoftware.svg?style=social&label=Follow&maxAge=1529000)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=splitsoftware)

## Overview
This Provider is designed to allow the use of OpenFeature with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with Python 3 and higher.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes using the Split Provider. Please see the [OpenFeature Documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api) for details on how to use the OpenFeature SDK.

```python
from open_feature import open_feature_api
from split_openfeature import SplitProvider

open_feature_api.set_provider(SplitProvider(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"))
```

If you are more familiar with Split or want access to other initialization options, you can provide a Split `client` to the constructor. See the [Split Java SDK Documentation](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020405151-Java-SDK) for more information.
```python
from open_feature import open_feature_api
from split_openfeature import SplitProvider
from splitio import get_factory

factory = get_factory("YOUR_API_KEY", config=config_file)
factory.block_until_ready(5)
open_feature_api.set_provider(SplitProvider(client=factory.client()))
```
where config_file is the Split config file you want to use

## Use of OpenFeature with Split
After the initial setup you can use OpenFeature according to their [documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api/).

One important note is that the Split Provider **requires a targeting key** to be set. Often times this should be set when evaluating the value of a flag by [setting an EvaluationContext](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) which contains the targeting key. An example flag evaluation is
```python
from open_feature import open_feature_api
from open_feature.evaluation_context.evaluation_context import EvaluationContext

client = open_feature_api.get_client("CLIENT_NAME")

context = EvaluationContext(targeting_key="TARGETING_KEY")
value = client.get_boolean_value("FLAG_NAME", False, context)
```
If the same targeting key is used repeatedly, the evaluation context may be set at the client level 
```python
context = EvaluationContext(targeting_key="TARGETING_KEY")
client.context = context
```
or at the OpenFeatureAPI level 
```python
from open_feature.open_feature_evaluation_context import set_api_evaluation_context

context = EvaluationContext(targeting_key="TARGETING_KEY")
set_api_evaluation_context(context)
````
If the context was set at the client or api level, it is not required to provide it during flag evaluation.
